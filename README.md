=============

This repository contains some GNU/Octave functions for machine learning.

## Example usage

If you want to use the linear regression code you can simply execute:

```matlab
addpath(genpath('path/to/linear regression'));
```

Done. You can now use the linear regression functions but also run test cases executing `test run` in order to check that everything works fine.

```matlab
test run
```

Infact, this command will execute the ["run.m"](run.md) file (see  ["linear regression/tests"]() directory).

Also, you can run demos ...

_TODO_

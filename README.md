What is this? [![Analytics](https://ga-beacon.appspot.com/UA-49657176-1/ml-octa-collection)](https://github.com/igrigorik/ga-beacon)
=============

This repository contains some GNU/Octave functions for machine learning.

## Instructions

If you want to use the linear regression code you can simply execute:

```matlab
addpath(genpath('path/to/linear regression'));
```

Done. You can now use the linear regression functions but also run test cases in order to check that everything works just fine:

```matlab
test('run')
```

This command will execute the [run.m](linear regression/tests/run.m) file in the [linear regression/tests](linear regression/tests/) directory.

Also, you can run demos ...

_TODO_
